# BlockchainNetworkAnalyzerEngineX

## Description

A decentralized ledger platform leveraging a novel consensus algorithm based on Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) and a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocol, enabling high-throughput and low-latency transactions with robust security guarantees.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the BlockchainNetworkAnalyzerEngineX software project:
- "Analyzes blockchain network topology using graph theory algorithms to identify central nodes and potential single points of failure",
- "Performs realtime transaction analysis using machine learningbased anomaly detection to identify potential security threats",
- "Provides detailed node performance metrics, including CPU usage, memory consumption, and network latency",
- "Supports customizable alerting and notification systems for unusual network activity or potential security breaches",
- "Includes a comprehensive data visualization module for illustrating blockchain network traffic patterns and transaction flows",
- "Offers advanced filtering and search capabilities for quickly identifying specific transactions or node interactions",
- "Integrates with popular blockchain explorers to provide seamless access to onchain data and analytics"
